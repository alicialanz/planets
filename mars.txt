Cold and dry but everything is my favorite color

The two moons might be a problem for Wolfman. 

I'd love to meet a rover.

Maybe even see the hab from that famous fictional human Mark Whatney.

Haven't seen the movie yet.  Could be interesting, just haven't had time.
Star Wars was a higher priority (another dry planet).
